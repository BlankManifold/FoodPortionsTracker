# RationsTracker

Android app for keep track of number of rations during a settable time period (daily, weekly, ...). For example, I will use it to track my food portions: Fruit, Vegetagle, Rise and Legumes, Pasta, Fish and similar, Meat, Eggs.

It meant to be for my **personal use** (1. only essential mechanics and features, 2. no fancy and useless UI, 3. I want to use this app as soon as possible).
